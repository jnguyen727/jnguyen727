## About Me

Hi, I’m Johnny Nguyen, a proud first-generation Computer Science student from Fort Wayne, Indiana, studying at Purdue University on the Systems Programming track.  
I’m passionate about software engineering, particularly in systems and software related to defense, security, and aerospace technologies.  
My current focus lies in signal processing and the use of RF data for defense applications.

I’m currently conducting RF signal research through The Data Mine at Purdue University in collaboration with Raytheon Technologies.  
My work focuses on the classification and visualization of in-flight signals using GPU-accelerated Python pipelines and spectrogram analysis.

## Experience

### The Data Mine at Purdue University & Raytheon Technologies (RTX)  
**Undergraduate Researcher — RF Simulation Team** | Aug 2025 – Present  
At The Data Mine at Purdue University, I collaborate with engineers from Raytheon Technologies (RTX) as part of the RF Simulation Team, where I develop and visualize synthetic RF signal datasets using TorchSig, NumPy, and SciPy. My work focuses on simulating and transforming RF data for signal classification models and supporting integration in an upcoming F-16 flight test.

### DegreeCat  
**Data Engineer Intern (Remote)** | Sep 2024 – Jan 2025  
As a Data Engineer Intern at DegreeCat, I built modular ETL pipelines in Python that standardized over 30,000 education records from multiple sources, cutting data cleaning time by 40% and enabling scalable analytics and dashboarding.

### Vincennes University  
**Head Early College Mathematics Tutor** | Mar 2024 – May 2024  
Previously, I served as Head Mathematics Tutor for the Early College Program at my high school, ran by Vincennes University, where I mentored first-generation students like myself, helping them strengthen mathematical understanding and academic confidence.

## Projects

### Bad Apple!! RF Spectrogram Renderer  
*Python, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib*  
- Rendered the “Bad Apple!!” PV entirely as RF-style spectrograms.  
- Translated image frames into frequency-domain signals using STFT-based pipelines.  
- Simulated frequency-aligned RF signals from 100 Hz and 12 kHz with real-time playback and visualization.
